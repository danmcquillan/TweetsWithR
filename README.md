Tweets with R
=============

This will ultimately be published as a How To on Poynter.org. Link to come. It is a simple example of how a journalist could use R to analyze tweets about a topic.

The code is heavily commented and directed toward absolute beginners.

Things left to be done:

* Deal with abandoning Python to pull tweets and write the R code to do it
* Learn LDA so I can pull topics
