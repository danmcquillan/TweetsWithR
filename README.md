Tweets with R
=============

This will ultimately be published as a How To on Poynter.org. Link to come. It is a simple example of how a journalist could use Python, Sqlite and R to analyze tweets about a topic.

The code is heavily commented and directed toward absolute beginners.

Things left to be done:

* Test the python/sqlite bits
* Write R scripts to pull the Sqlite DB into R
* Write R to analyze and visualize tweets
